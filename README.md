# Description

The Lcss adapter is a board designed and developed for data acquisition from diverse types of Low-Cost Small gas Sensors having analog outputs. The board can be powered by the USB port or through a 3,3V Li-Ion battery. The typical power consumption is less than 100mWatts at 5 Volts. This device can be used with the [SentinAir](https://github.com/domenico-suriano/SentinAir) system, a PC (Windows or Linux based), or in the stand-alone mode. It converts the input analog signals coming out from the sensors into digital data that are given as output through the USB port or the RN42XVP Bluetooth adapter. The use of the LCSS adapter and its hardware architecture have also been described in the articles [A portable air quality monitoring unit and a modular, flexible tool for on-field evaluation and calibration of low-cost gas sensors](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ohx.2021.e00198) published on HardwareX by Elsevier, and [“Design and Development of a Flexible, Plug-and-Play, Cost-Effective Tool for on-Field Evaluation of Gas Sensors”](https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8812025) published in the Journal of Sensors. The size of the board is 7,5cm x 6,3cm, and it has an in-built temperature sensor (the TC1047A by Microchip), and a relative humidiìty sensor (the HIH5031 by Honeywell). The maximum number of inputs is eight. They must be d.c. analog signals ranging from 0 to 3,3 Volts.
